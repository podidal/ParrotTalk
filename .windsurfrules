Naming Stability: Variable, function, method, and class names must not change unless explicitly instructed. Use existing naming conventions consistently.
File Length Limit: Each file must not exceed 200 lines. If the code approaches this limit, split it into logically related modules or files.
Modularity: Follow a declarative and functional programming approach for better modularity and reusability.
